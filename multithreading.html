**Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.<br>

--->A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.<br>

--->However, we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads use a shared memory area. They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less time than process.<br><br>

Multitasking is a process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously. We use multitasking to utilize the CPU. <br><br>Multitasking can be achieved in two ways:<br>

--->Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing)<br>
--->Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading)<br>
<b>1) Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing)</b><br>
**Each process has an address in memory. In other words, each process allocates a separate memory area.<br>
**A process is heavyweight.<br>
**Cost of communication between the process is high.<br>
**Switching from one process to another requires some time for saving and loading registers, memory maps, updating lists, etc.<br>
<b>2) Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading)</b><br>
**Threads share the same address space.<br>
**A thread is lightweight.<br>
**Cost of communication between the thread is low.<br>
