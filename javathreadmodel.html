<center> <h1>Thread Model</h1> </center>
<h2><u>Definition</u></h2>
<font size="5">Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time. Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.</font> 
<h2>Threads exist in several states:</h2>
  <font size="5"> <p>*New - When we create an instance of Thread class, a thread is in a new state.<br>
   *Running - The Java thread is in running state.<br>
   *Suspended - A running thread can be suspended, which temporarily suspends its activity. A suspended thread can then be resumed, allowing it to pick up where it left off.<br>
   *Blocked - A Java thread can be blocked when waiting for a resource.<br>
   *Terminated - A thread can be terminated, which halts its execution immediately at any given time. Once a thread is terminated, it cannot be resumed.<br></font></p>
